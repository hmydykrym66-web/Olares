**Olares is an open-source personal cloud OS you operate in plain language, built to run AI agents and LLMs on hardware you own.**

Powered by Kubernetes, it turns your machines into a self-hosted AI platform accessible from any browser, giving everyone from individual users to small teams a unified place for compute, storage, networking, and apps.

> 🌟 *If Olares is useful to you, consider giving the project a star. Your support encourages us to keep improving it.*

## Why Olares

Great AI needs to know you. That requires access to your files, messages, and history. Many cloud AI services store this sensitive data on third-party servers and charge based on usage.

Olares brings AI home, so you can run agents like [OpenClaw](https://www.olares.com/docs/use-cases/openclaw) with local LLMs on hardware you own while still enjoying the access and convenience of the cloud.

![Comparison of a digital life built on public cloud services with one powered by open-source apps on an Olares personal cloud](https://app.cdn.olares.com/github/olares/public-cloud-to-personal-cloud.jpg)

Features include:

- **One-click local AI:** Install open-source AI apps and models from [Olares Market](https://www.olares.com/market/) with one click.
- **Accelerated computing management:** Pool GPUs and other accelerators across nodes, with time-slicing, memory-slicing, and exclusive GPU modes for AI, media, and gaming workloads.
- **[Files and storage management](https://www.olares.com/docs/manual/olares/files/):** Access local files, synced data, connected cloud storage, and external SMB/NFS shares through the built-in Files app, with [configurable backups](https://www.olares.com/docs/manual/olares/settings/backup).
- **[Private networking and access controls](https://www.olares.com/docs/developer/concepts/network):** Use a private VPN, reverse proxy, and public, private, or internal entrances to give apps HTTPS endpoints without manually exposing individual ports.
- **Anytime, anywhere access:** Use your Olares ID and [LarePass](https://www.olares.com/docs/manual/larepass/) to access all your services from a phone, desktop, or browser.
- **A suite of system apps:** Files, Vault, Market, Dashboard, Control Hub, and more, ready the moment you log in.

## Get started

### Linux script requirements

Olares installs on a Linux host (bare metal or VM), with dedicated installation methods for Windows, macOS, and Raspberry Pi. Requirements vary by platform and installation method. The Linux script used below requires:

- **CPU:** At least 4 cores
- **RAM:** At least 8 GB of available memory
- **Storage:** At least 150 GB of available SSD storage; installation will fail on an HDD
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 to 25.04, or Debian 12 or 13

A dedicated GPU is optional and enables local AI acceleration.

### Install and activate

1. Create your Olares ID in [LarePass](https://www.olares.com/docs/manual/larepass/), the client app that adds secure login, a built-in VPN, and file sync.

2. On your Linux host, run:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://olares.sh | bash -
    ```

    This command downloads the official installer from `olares.sh` and runs it with Bash. For complete requirements, platform-specific instructions, and troubleshooting, see the [Linux script installation guide](https://www.olares.com/docs/manual/get-started/install-linux-script).

    For Windows, macOS, Raspberry Pi, or a VM, choose your platform in the [installation guide](https://www.olares.com/docs/manual/get-started/install-olares).

3. Follow the guided web wizard, or do it entirely from the terminal with the [Activate using the Olares CLI](https://www.olares.com/docs/manual/best-practices/activate-olares-using-cli) tutorial.

Once activated, you can access Olares from any browser at an address based on your Olares ID. For example, if your Olares ID is `marvin123`, your desktop is at `https://desktop.marvin123.olares.com`.

## Key use cases

- **Use a personal AI agent.** Delegate research, coding, file management, and routine automation through plain language.
- **Run generative AI locally.** Chat with open models, generate images and video, and connect local models to other apps, all from your own hardware.
- **Manage smart home devices and media.** Connect home automation tools and stream your personal music and video libraries.
- **Build and host agentic apps.** Develop, test, and run apps and workflows in isolated environments on Olares.
- **Process audio locally.** Transcribe meetings, translate recordings, and generate speech without uploading audio to a third-party service.
- **Create a self-hosted workspace.** Give your family or team tools for documents, automation, project management, and communication.
- **Manage your personal data.** Store, sync, back up, and access files, photos, and documents across your devices.

## System architecture

Just as public clouds offer IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS layers, Olares provides open-source alternatives to each of these layers.

![Olares architecture mapping open-source components to IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS layers alongside public cloud equivalents](https://app.cdn.olares.com/github/olares/olares-architecture.jpg)

For a detailed description of each component, refer to [Olares architecture](https://www.olares.com/docs/developer/concepts/system-architecture).

> 🔍 **How is Olares different from traditional NAS?**
>
> Olares focuses on building an all-in-one self-hosted personal cloud experience. Its core features and target users differ significantly from Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems, which primarily focus on network storage. For more details, see [Compare Olares and NAS](https://www.olares.com/blog/compare-olares-and-nas/).
